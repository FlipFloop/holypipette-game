* Semiautomatic calibration:
    user goes to 4 points, reposition pipette, possibly automatically (template matching)
* Debugging gui for the SM10; reproduce movements, test if image moved


* Adjust speeds for horizontal moves
* Motor ranges using Home and Setting Home direction
* Maximization of calibration size
    (alternatively: abort when CalibrationError)
    check stage target position
* Possible optimization: instead of sleep before snap, do the template matching until stable results
* Automatically move and focus pipette when appearing on screen
    ideas: if tip on screen, look at how total intensity changes with focus
* Semiautomatic recalibration:
    pipette is put in approximate focus, then template matching (requires storing photos of pipette)
* DLL Path in multiclamp
* Resistance in status bar
* Safe move: add withdraw with correct direction
