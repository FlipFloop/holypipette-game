* Use steps for microscope moves?
    > maybe directly inserted in relative_move: does steps instead of absolute moves

* Check correlation in template matching, compare with correlation within stack
* inversion of z in calibration?
* Avoid collisions
* Maximization of calibration size
    -> need to know minimum pipette Z (use platform 0?)
    -> need to know manipulator and platform ranges
* check position with image
* test mosaic
