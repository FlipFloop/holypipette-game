* Configuration script for each rig
* Possible optimization: instead of sleep before snap, do the template matching until stable results
* Avoid collisions
    find out direction of vertical displacements
* Maximization of calibration size
    -> need to know minimum pipette Z (use platform 0?)
    -> need to know manipulator and platform ranges
* test mosaic
