* Stage calibration on entire image: test
* Avoid collisions: test
* Maximization of calibration size
    (alternatively: abort when CalibrationError)
    check stage target position
* Safe pipette move to target (+10 um)
* Resistance meter
* Keyboard-based application
    save/load configuration
    calibrate
    recalibrate (tip)
* Possible optimization: instead of sleep before snap, do the template matching until stable results
