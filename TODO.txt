* Debugging gui for the SM10; reproduce movements, test if image moved
* Safe move: add withdraw
* Adjust speeds for horizontal moves
* Motor ranges using Home and Setting Home direction
* Maximization of calibration size
    (alternatively: abort when CalibrationError)
    check stage target position
* Resistance meter
* Possible optimization: instead of sleep before snap, do the template matching until stable results
