* Stage calibration on entire image
* Avoid collisions
    find out direction of vertical displacements
* Maximization of calibration size
    -> need to know minimum pipette Z (use platform 0?)
    -> need to know manipulator and platform ranges
* Resistance meter
* Keyboard-based application
    save/load configuration
    calibrate
    recalibrate (tip)
* Possible optimization: instead of sleep before snap, do the template matching until stable results
