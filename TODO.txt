* Replace wait until still by wait until target reached (with deadline)
* Calibrate without stage
* Check compensation movements
* Check whether best match is with the Z border
* Semiautomatic calibration:
    user goes to 4 points, reposition pipette, possibly automatically (template matching)


* Adjust speeds for horizontal moves
* Motor ranges using Home and Setting Home direction
* Maximization of calibration size
    (alternatively: abort when CalibrationError)
    check stage target position
* Possible optimization: instead of sleep before snap, do the template matching until stable results

** Automatically move and focus pipette when appearing on screen
    ideas: if tip on screen, look at how total intensity changes with focus
    In fact: move pipette up along X axis until there is no black on one border, or intensity
    disappears quickly. Then move up along Z axis until template matching works.

** Semiautomatic recalibration:
    pipette is put in approximate focus, then template matching (requires storing photos of pipette)
* DLL Path in multiclamp
* Resistance in status bar
* Safe move: add withdraw with correct direction
